# Geospatial Data Query in PostGIS
Querying geospatial data in PostGIS involves using SQL statements to retrieve and analyze spatial information stored in a PostgreSQL database with the PostGIS extension. PostGIS is an extension for PostgreSQL that adds support for geographic objects, allowing for the storage and querying of spatial data.

## Files

- **geographybasic:** This file provides a basic introduction to geospatial concepts and the use of PostGIS for handling geographic data.

- **installation_of_postgis:** Here, you will find instructions for installing and setting up PostGIS, ensuring you have the necessary tools to work with geospatial data.

- **loading_of_sql_data:** This tells how to load SQL data into your PostGIS-enabled PostgreSQL database. This step is crucial for setting up the foundation for spatial queries.

- **importing_file_using_shp2pgsql:** This will walks you through the process of importing shapefiles into your PostGIS database using the `shp2pgsql` tool. Shapefiles are a common geospatial vector data format.

- **Roads:** Real world example using roads network data. This demonstrates how to perform spatial queries on real-world datasets gain hands-on experience with PostGIS.
- **cb_2017_us_state_20m:** Explore practical examples using U.S. state data.

## Usage

1. **Geography Basic:**
   - The `geographybasic` file is to understand fundamental geospatial concepts.

2. **Installation of PostGIS:**
   - The instructions in the `installation_of_postgis` file is used to set up PostGIS in your PostgreSQL database.

3. **Loading of SQL Data:**
   - Used `loading_of_sql_data` for loading SQL data into your PostGIS-enabled database.

4. **Importing File Using shp2pgsql:**
   - Import shapefiles into your database using the `shp2pgsql` tool with the help of the `importing_file_using_shp2pgsql` file.

5. **Real world- Spatial Data Analysis:**
   - Practical examples with real datasets in the `roads and us_state_data` file. This demonstrates how to query road and U.S. state data, providing valuable insights into geospatial data handling.
