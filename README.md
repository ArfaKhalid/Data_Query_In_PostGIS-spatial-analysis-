# Geospatial Data Query in PostGIS

This repository has queries for working with geospatial data using PostGIS. PostGIS is an extension for PostgreSQL that adds support for geographic objects, allowing for the storage and querying of spatial data.

## Files

- **geographybasic:** This file provides a basic introduction to geospatial concepts and the use of PostGIS for handling geographic data.

- **installation_of_postgis:** Here, you will find instructions for installing and setting up PostGIS, ensuring you have the necessary tools to work with geospatial data.

- **loading_of_sql_data:** This tells how to load SQL data into your PostGIS-enabled PostgreSQL database. This step is crucial for setting up the foundation for spatial queries.

- **importing_file_using_shp2pgsql:** This will walks you through the process of importing shapefiles into your PostGIS database using the `shp2pgsql` tool. Shapefiles are a common geospatial vector data format.

- **Roads:** Real world example using roads network data. This demonstrates how to perform spatial queries on real-world datasets gain hands-on experience with PostGIS.
- **cb_2017_us_state_20m:** Explore practical examples using U.S. state data.

## Usage

1. **Geography Basic:**
   - The `geographybasic` file is to understand fundamental geospatial concepts.

2. **Installation of PostGIS:**
   - The instructions in the `installation_of_postgis` file is used to set up PostGIS in your PostgreSQL database.

3. **Loading of SQL Data:**
   - Used `loading_of_sql_data` for loading SQL data into your PostGIS-enabled database.

4. **Importing File Using shp2pgsql:**
   - Import shapefiles into your database using the `shp2pgsql` tool with the help of the `importing_file_using_shp2pgsql` file.

5. **Real world- Spatial Data Analysis:**
   - Practical examples with real datasets in the `roads and us_state_data` file. This demonstrates how to query road and U.S. state data, providing valuable insights into geospatial data handling.
